## Installation

Ready for use on iOS 13+.

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/sparrowcode/SPSafeSymbols", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.1"))
]
```

### CocoaPods:

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager. For usage and installation instructions, visit their website. To integrate using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SPSafeSymbols'
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of dependency managers, you can integrate manually. Put `Sources/SPSafeSymbols` folder in your Xcode project. Make sure to enable `Copy items if needed` and `Create groups`.
